# Both `upload_pypi` and `upload_testpypi` jobs are based on

# The important bit here is that we use GitHub Actions as the "trusted
# publisher" to publish packages on both PyPI and TestPyPI.  We do not
# use long-lived tokens anymore.  Instead, both PyPI and TestPyPI are
# configured to trust this GH Actions workflow, and the workflow will
# use a short-lived tokens minted by them.

#
# There is a bit of duplication below but that seems to be necessary
# because the environment configuration is different for PyPI and
# TestPyPI.  Perhaps the duplication is not necessary, but let us just
# stick with the Python Package User Guide's recommendation.
