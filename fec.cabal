description:
  This code, based on zfec by Zooko, based on code by Luigi
  Rizzo implements an erasure code, or forward error
  correction code. The most widely known example of an erasure
  code is the RAID-5 algorithm which makes it so that in the
  event of the loss of any one hard drive, the stored data can
  be completely recovered.  The algorithm in the zfec package
  has a similar effect, but instead of recovering from the loss
  of only a single element, it can be parameterized to choose in
  advance the number of elements whose loss it can tolerate.
