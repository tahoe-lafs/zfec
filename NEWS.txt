* Release 1.5.5 (2020-11-12)

** Upload wheel packages to the Python Package Index.
   Wheel packages for Python 2.7/Windows turned out to be broken

   Wheel packages are now built for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8, PyPy2,
   and PyPy3, for macOS, GNU/Linux, and Windows platforms, using
   cibuildwheel on GitHub Actions.  No changes to zfec itself.

* Release 1.5.3 (2018-04-07)

** Fix setup.py problem that broke builds on slackware (or other systems with
   setuptools-22.0.5, which is too old to know that "name" might come from
   the setup.cfg metadata section)


* Release 1.5.2 (2018-02-06)

** Add Appveyor (CI for Windows)
** Use older C syntax to appease the Windows compilers we use on Appveyor.
   The previous release just didn't compile there, which broke Tahoe builds.

   strings like "0+unknown" after pip install (#11)
