meejah trying to figure out how to make a release, because it's not documented.

There are tokens in GitHub, for both normal and test PyPI.
Only "exarkun" and "sajith" are listed on the test instance (several others listed in production).
meejah created a zfec-only, production-only token on November 15, 2024.
meejah cannot do "trusted publishing" due to lack of permissions.

A tag must be created and pushed to trigger the publishing flow.

There is no documentation on how to create a tag, so meejah followed this procedure:

git checkout master
git status  # look for any changed / uncommitted files
git tag  # list existing tags

tried to verify latest:

    $ git tag --verify zfec-1.5.7.4
    error: zfec-1.5.7.4: cannot verify a non-tag object of type commit.

Seems like maybe these _aren't_ actually "tags", somehow?

** Create a branch for the new release
   git checkout -b release-1.6.0.0

** Update the NEWS.txt, by examining:
   git log --merges zfec-1.5.7.4..

** Commit the above

** Create a tag

   git tag -s -u meejah@meejah.ca -m "Release 1.6.0.0" zfec-1.6.0.0

** Push the branch + tag

   git push origin-push release-1.6.0.0 zfec-1.6.0.0
